# Module 2 Challenge - Personal Portfolio

## Description

Here I built a website to use as a portfolio to display my work to potential employers. This project was used as a learning experience to take an idea and translate that idea into a website using html and css for formatting and design. This website gives me a current base to display my work as I continue through the bootcamp course and gave me invaluable experience using css and html.

## Special Thanks

Thanks goes out to all the instructors and teacher assistants for their clear instruction and prompt and thorough answers to all my questions. Also, to all the students who joined in the study groups for their active participation and alternative perspectives. I was able to gain multiple insights I otherwise may not have gained towards the project without them. There is always strength in numbers.
